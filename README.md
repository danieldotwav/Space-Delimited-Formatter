# Space Delimited Formatter

## Overview

This program reads content from a file named `input.txt`, formats it by appending a space after each line, and then outputs the formatted content into a new file called `Formatted.txt`. Additionally, it prints the formatted content to the console. This simple utility is particularly useful for basic text manipulation where consistent spacing is needed.

## Features

- **File Reading**: Efficiently reads lines from `input.txt`.
- **Content Formatting**: Adds a space after each line read from the input file.
- **File Writing**: Outputs the formatted content into `Formatted.txt`.
- **Console Output**: Prints the formatted content to the console for immediate verification.

## Usage

After compiling the program, ensure that you have an `input.txt` file in the same directory as your executable. The program will read this file, format its contents, and output the result to both `Formatted.txt` and the console.

- Input file: `input.txt`
- Output file: `Formatted.txt`

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Opening**: Ensure both `input.txt` and `Formatted.txt` are not being used by another program.
- **Compilation Errors**: Make sure your C++ compiler is correctly installed and your command path is properly set.
